MoorxCode

This is my personal collection of useful game programming code stuff and to some
extent, acts as my personal programming portfolio. Everything is under BSD 
license, so have fun with it! However, I'd be glad to get some feedback if you
find my code useful or think it sucks... You can reach me at mail.clang@gmail.com

The code is formatted using the Google C++ style guide as a personal exercise in
adhering to someone else's standards. So if you find the way this code looks 
funny or strange - blame the Google guys!

To build the code, use SConstruct. So far I only built it on MacOS, using clang
and gcc, but I'll soon test it on Visual C++.
